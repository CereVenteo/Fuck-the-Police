### The Assigment 2 Contain

In this demo we will have the possibility to acquire with points: police cars, cages for criminals and desks for police.

At the beginning of the game, we will see how the agents go to work at their desks.
The civilians will come to request help and the comrades will bring us criminals for interrogation.

To process the civilians we will have to wait until they take a turn at the secretary and then click on an agent to call some civilian in turn to help him.
When civilians are waiting with their assigned turn they will wander nervously around the waiting area.

To carry out an interrogation we will need to have 2 free agents in addition to the interrogation rooms, then we will click on a criminal that we have locked up and if the conditions are met we will proceed with the interrogation.

When the day ends we can see how civilians and the secretary leave the police station but the agents and criminals continue in it to carry out interrogations.

For each civilian processed and each interrogation complete we will receive the points that we can use to buy accessories for the police station, with the final objective of achieving the 5 stars and declare ourselves as the best police station in the county.
