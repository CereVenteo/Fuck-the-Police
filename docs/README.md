During the demonstration, we will have a secretary who will go to her position as secretary to manage the civilians' shifts. Four policemen who go to their respective desks, and a suspect in the interrogation room, circling waiting to be interrogated. We will also have civilians who will come to consult the agents. When the cycle changes, the secretary will take a break to go to the bathroom because she is older and has incontinence, the police, one of them will go to the interrogation room to interrogate the suspect, while the rest will go to the next room to look the interrogation.
